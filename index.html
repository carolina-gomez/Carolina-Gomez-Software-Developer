          <h2> Introduction </h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Carolina Gomez. I'm a software developer based in Houston, TX.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my hobbies outside of software development include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Photography </li>
            <li> Painting </li>
            <li> Gardening </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
             Currently, I'm preparing for Thinkful's engineering immersive program. I'm excited to learn and connect with other software developers, so feel free to <a href="#contact"><strong>reach out</strong></a>!

          <h2> About Carolina </h2>
          <p>
            After graduating college, I prioritized my family and volunteering with local organizations in my hometown. When I became a mother, I met some very special women that created new opportunities for themselves with an impressive entrepreneurial spirit. I was inspired by them to look into updating my skills and take action to start my journey as a <strong>software developer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I started to look for bootcamps, I found <em>Thinkful</em>. I'm excited to start this new path and maybe down the road, be able to contribute and inspire other new mothers to take action that benefits their family as well.
